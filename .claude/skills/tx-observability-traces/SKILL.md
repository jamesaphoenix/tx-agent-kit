# tx Observability And Traces

- `tx diag`: Diagnostics
- `tx diag dashboard`: Start API server + dashboard UI
- `tx diag doctor`: Run system health checks
- `tx diag stats`: Show queue metrics and health overview
- `tx doctor`: System health checks
- `tx stats`: Show queue metrics and health overview
- `tx trace`: Execution tracing for debugging run failures
- `tx trace errors`: Show recent errors across all runs
- `tx trace heartbeat`: Update run heartbeat state

## Search And Shell Fixes

When working in Claude Code, prefer `rg -n <pattern> <path>` and `rg --files <path>` over broad `grep -r` or fragile `find` pipelines.

If a shell/search command fails because of malformed flags, truncated paths, or broken quotes:

- rerun it as a smaller `rg` command with an explicit directory
- avoid partial paths like `node_modul` or unterminated quotes
- replace `grep -r` with `rg -n` unless `rg` is unavailable
- replace broad `find` probes with `rg --files` when you are really locating source files
