# Example: tx-agent-kit Overview Source

Source document pattern:

- `/<some-source-path>/specs/<overview-or-requirements-doc>.md`

Concrete example used for this reference:

- `/Users/jamesaphoenix/Desktop/projects/just-understanding-data/octospark/specs/requirements.md`

Why this is a strong overview example:

- It captures project-level context that spans multiple eventual PRDs and design docs.
- It keeps market framing, target audience, actor definitions, launch features, and platform strategy together.
- It demonstrates that an overview can stay rich and narrative before downstream decomposition happens.

# Detailed Source Material

## tx-agent-kit — Business Requirements

## 1. What is tx-agent-kit?

tx-agent-kit is an autonomous social growth platform that makes organic social media as measurable and scalable as paid advertising.

### Target Audience

The primary audience is marketing teams and technical marketing professionals — social media managers, content marketers, brand managers, and small-to-mid-size marketing agencies.

## 3. Actors

| Actor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Social Media Manager | Primary day-to-day user |
| Campaign Manager | Plans and runs multi-post campaigns |
| Approver | Reviews scheduled content before it goes live |
| Team Admin | Manages membership and permissions |
| Organization Admin | Manages billing and org-wide settings |

## 4. High Level Features

- Social account management
- Media library
- AI content generation
- Scheduling and publishing
- Content approval workflow
- Campaigns and budgets
- Analytics
- Knowledge base
- Billing and pricing
- Team and role management

## 5. Platform Support

```

Use an overview like this when the user is still describing the product, the launch boundary, and the top-level system context. Do not prematurely force it into one subsystem's vocabulary.
