## tx init

```text
tx init - Initialize task database

Usage: tx init [--db <path>] [--claude] [--codex] [--watchdog] [--watchdog-runtime <auto|codex|claude|both>]

Initializes the tx database and required tables. Creates .tx/tasks.db
by default. Safe to run multiple times (idempotent).

Interactive tx init lets the user choose the exact Claude/Codex tx skills
to install during onboarding. Passing --claude or --codex installs the
full default bundle non-interactively.

Options:
  --db <path>   Database path (default: .tx/tasks.db)
  --claude      Scaffold Claude Code integration (.claude/skills; no CLAUDE.md by default)
  --codex       Scaffold Codex integration (.codex/skills + .codex/rules; no AGENTS.md by default)
  --watchdog    Scaffold watchdog launcher/scripts/assets (optional later)
  --watchdog-runtime <mode>
                Runtime mode for watchdog: auto|codex|claude|both (default: auto, requires --watchdog)
  --help        Show this help

Examples:
  tx init                     # Initialize database + choose skills interactively
  tx init --claude            # Database + full generated Claude Code skills bundle
  tx init --codex             # Database + full generated Codex skills bundle + rules
  tx init --claude --codex    # Database + both integrations
  tx init --watchdog          # Optional later: watchdog scaffolding (runtime auto-detect)
  tx init --watchdog --watchdog-runtime both
                              # Require both codex and claude runtimes for watchdog
  tx init --db ~/my-tasks.db  # Use custom path
```

## tx list
