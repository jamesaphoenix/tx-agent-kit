# Smoke Tests

Smoke tests verify that a deployed environment is functional by exercising the critical API flows end-to-end. They run automatically after deployment (when `RUN_SMOKE=1`) and can be triggered manually against any API endpoint.

## Usage

```bash
# Run against a specific environment
API_BASE_URL=https://api.staging.example.com pnpm deploy:smoke

# Run against local development
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000 pnpm deploy:smoke
```

## What it tests

The smoke test script (`scripts/deploy/smoke-api.sh`) runs a sequence of API calls that covers every critical flow:

### 1. Health check

```
GET /health
```

Verifies the API is responding and reports `status: "healthy"`.

### 2. Authentication

```
POST /v1/auth/sign-up    (creates a test user with random credentials)
GET  /v1/auth/me          (verifies the returned JWT token works)
```

Signs up a new user with a random email and password, then uses the returned JWT to verify the `/v1/auth/me` endpoint returns the authenticated user.

### 3. Workspace CRUD

```
POST /v1/workspaces       (creates a workspace)
GET  /v1/workspaces       (lists workspaces, confirms creation)
```

Creates a workspace under the authenticated user and verifies it appears in the list.

### 4. Task CRUD

```
POST /v1/tasks            (creates a task in the workspace)
GET  /v1/tasks            (lists tasks, confirms creation)
```

Creates a task linked to the workspace and verifies it appears in the filtered task list.

### 5. Invitation flow

```
POST /v1/auth/sign-up              (creates a second user as invitee)
POST /v1/invitations               (invites the second user to the workspace)
GET  /v1/invitations               (lists invitations)
POST /v1/invitations/:token/accept (accepts the invitation)
POST /v1/invitations/:token/accept (re-accepts, expects 404 - idempotency)
```

This exercises the full invitation lifecycle. It creates a second user account, sends a workspace invitation from the first user to the second, accepts the invitation using the invitation token, and then verifies that accepting the same invitation again returns a 404 (the invitation is consumed).

## Test data

All test data is created with random suffixes:

| Field | Pattern |
|-------|---------|
| Email | `deploy-smoke-<timestamp>-<random>@example.com` |
| Password | `Sm0ke-<random>-Pass!` |
| Workspace name | `Smoke Workspace <random>` |
| Task title | `Smoke Task <random>` |

This prevents collisions when running smoke tests multiple times against the same environment.

## Status code assertions

The script asserts exact HTTP status codes for each operation:

| Operation | Expected status |
|-----------|----------------|
| Health check | 200 |
| Sign up | 201 |
| Auth me | 200 |
| Create workspace | 201 |
| List workspaces | 200 |
| Create task | 201 |
| List tasks | 200 |
| Create invitation | 201 |
| List invitations | 200 |
| Accept invitation | 200 |
| Re-accept invitation | 404 |

Any unexpected status code causes the script to exit with an error, clearly identifying which step failed.

## Integration with deployment

The deploy scripts run smoke tests by default after bringing up services:

```bash
# Deploy with smoke tests (default)
pnpm deploy:staging

# Deploy without smoke tests
RUN_SMOKE=0 pnpm deploy:staging
```

If smoke tests fail, the deployment is flagged as unhealthy. The deployed services remain running for debugging, but the deploy script exits with a non-zero status.
