# Mobile App (`apps/mobile`)

The mobile application is built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and React Native. It provides the same core functionality as the web app, including authentication, organization management, and invitations, through a native mobile interface.

## Architecture

The mobile app follows the same client-only pattern as the web app. It consumes `API_BASE_URL` from Expo config and communicates exclusively with the API server.

```
Mobile App -> Axios Client -> API Server (apps/api)
```

There is no local database or offline-first logic. The app is a thin client that delegates all business logic to the API.

## Key Modules

| Module | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Environment | `lib/env.ts` | Runtime configuration read from Expo's config system, not from `process.env` directly |
| Auth Token | `lib/auth-token.ts` | Secure token storage using the platform's native secure storage mechanisms |
| Axios Client | `lib/axios.ts` | Pre-configured Axios instance pointing to `API_BASE_URL` with auth token injection |
| Client API | `lib/client-api.ts` | Typed API client methods wrapping Axios calls with proper request/response typing |
| Client Auth | `lib/client-auth.ts` | Authentication flow logic: sign-up, sign-in, token refresh, and session management |
| URL State | `lib/url-state.ts` | Navigation state management adapted for React Navigation rather than browser URLs |
| Session Store | `stores/session-store.ts` | Centralized session state management for the authenticated user context |

## Component Test Suites

The mobile app maintains full component test coverage:

| Component | Test File |
|-----------|-----------|
| `AuthForm` | `components/AuthForm.test.tsx` |
| `CreateOrganizationForm` | `components/CreateOrganizationForm.test.tsx` |
| `CreateInvitationForm` | `components/CreateInvitationForm.test.tsx` |
| `AcceptInvitationForm` | `components/AcceptInvitationForm.test.tsx` |
| `SignOutButton` | `components/SignOutButton.test.tsx` |
| `AuthBootstrapProvider` | `components/AuthBootstrapProvider.test.tsx` |

## Unit Test Suites

Core utility modules have dedicated unit tests:

| Module | Coverage |
|--------|----------|
| `env` | Environment config resolution |
| `auth-token` | Token storage read/write/clear |
| `axios` | Client configuration and interceptors |
| `client-api` | API method typing and request construction |
| `client-auth` | Auth flow state transitions |
| `url-state` | Navigation state serialization |
| `session-store` | Session state management |

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run mobile unit tests
pnpm --filter @tx-agent-kit/mobile test
```
