# Core (`packages/core`)

The core package contains the domain logic for the entire system. It is organized as DDD domain slices under `src/domains/`, with each domain following a strict folder structure and layer dependency direction.

## Domain Structure

Each domain slice must contain these folders:

```
packages/core/src/domains/<domain>/
  domain/       # Entities, value objects, pure business rules
  ports/        # Capability contracts (Effect Context.Tag services)
  application/  # Use-case orchestration (Effect services)
  adapters/     # External system adapter implementations
```

The `runtime/` folder (layer wiring and composition) and `ui/` folder (presentation-facing helpers) are optional.

The `repositories/` and `services/` folders are forbidden. Concrete persistence lives in `packages/db`, and use-case orchestration belongs in `application/`.

## Current Domains

| Domain | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `auth` | User authentication, principal extraction, session management |
| `workspace` | Workspace CRUD, membership, invitations |
| `task` | Task CRUD within workspaces |

## Layer Dependency Direction

Dependencies must flow inward. The enforcement script validates every import path:

```
domain     -> domain only
ports      -> domain, ports
application -> domain, ports, application
adapters   -> domain, ports, adapters
runtime    -> all layers
ui         -> all layers
```

Cross-domain imports are forbidden. Each domain is a self-contained unit.

## Domain Layer

The domain layer defines entities, value objects, and pure business rules. It must not import anything outside its own domain layer.

```typescript
// packages/core/src/domains/task/domain/task-domain.ts
export interface TaskRecord {
  id: string
  workspaceId: string
  title: string
  description: string | null
  status: TaskStatus
  createdByUserId: string
  createdAt: Date
}

export const isValidTaskTitle = (title: string): boolean => {
  const trimmed = title.trim()
  return trimmed.length >= 1 && trimmed.length <= 200
}
```

**Determinism constraint**: `Date.now()`, `new Date()`, and `Math.random()` are forbidden in domain-layer code. Inject time and randomness through ports.

## Ports Layer

Ports define abstract capability contracts using Effect's `Context.Tag`:

```typescript
// packages/core/src/domains/task/ports/task-ports.ts
export class TaskStorePort extends Context.Tag('TaskStorePort')<
  TaskStorePort,
  {
    list: (workspaceId: string, params: ListParams) => Effect.Effect<PaginatedResult<TaskRecord>, unknown>
    getById: (id: string) => Effect.Effect<TaskRecord | null, unknown>
    create: (input: CreateTaskInput) => Effect.Effect<TaskRecord | null, unknown>
    update: (input: UpdateTaskInput) => Effect.Effect<TaskRecord | null, unknown>
    remove: (id: string) => Effect.Effect<{ deleted: true }, unknown>
  }
>() {}
```

Ports must return `Effect.Effect` (never `Promise`), declare an explicit kind marker (`crud` or `custom`), avoid implementing layers with `Layer.succeed`/`Layer.effect`, and import port types from the domain layer via `*Record` interfaces.

## Application Layer

Application modules orchestrate use cases by combining ports:

```typescript
// packages/core/src/domains/task/application/task-service.ts
export class TaskService extends Context.Tag('TaskService')<TaskService, {
  getById: (principal: Principal, taskId: string) => Effect.Effect<Task, CoreError>
  create: (principal: Principal, input: CreateTaskCommand) => Effect.Effect<Task, CoreError>
  // ...
}>() {}
```

## Governance Rules

All domain layer files must use named exports; `export default` is forbidden. Environment reads must go through dedicated config modules rather than accessing `process.env` directly. Type assertions to `any` are not permitted. Model unknowns explicitly and decode with schema at boundaries. Suppression directives such as `@ts-ignore` are likewise forbidden; fix the underlying type issue instead of suppressing the error.
