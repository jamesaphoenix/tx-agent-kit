# Auth (`packages/auth`)

The auth package provides low-level authentication primitives: password hashing and JWT token operations. It is consumed by the API server's auth routes and the core domain's auth service.

## Capabilities

### Password Hashing

Secure password hashing using industry-standard algorithms. Provides hash and verify functions:

```typescript
import { hashPassword, verifyPassword } from '@tx-agent-kit/auth'

const hashed = await hashPassword(plaintext)
const isValid = await verifyPassword(plaintext, hashed)
```

### JWT Tokens

Token generation and verification for session management:

```typescript
import { signToken, verifyToken } from '@tx-agent-kit/auth'

const token = await signToken({ userId: user.id })
const payload = await verifyToken(token)
```

## Environment

Auth-specific configuration (e.g., JWT secret, token expiry) is read from `packages/auth/src/env.ts`. Direct `process.env` access is forbidden in other source modules within this package.

## Usage in the Stack

The auth package sits between the API layer and the core domain:

```
API Route (apps/api/src/routes/auth.ts)
  -> AuthService (packages/core/src/domains/auth/application/)
    -> Auth Primitives (packages/auth)
    -> User Repository (packages/db/src/repositories/)
```

The API route handles HTTP concerns, the domain service orchestrates the auth flow, and this package provides the cryptographic primitives.
