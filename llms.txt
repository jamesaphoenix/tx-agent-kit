# tx-agent-kit

> Agent-first TypeScript monorepo. You tell the agent what to build. The agent builds it. The repo makes sure it's built right.

Production starter with Effect HTTP, Temporal, Next.js, Drizzle, and Expo. 50+ mechanical invariants enforced by lint rules, structural scripts, and shell checks. Every architectural decision is a build error, not a code review comment.

## Repo orientation

CLAUDE.md:Agent operating guide (constraints, DDD pattern, workflow, enforcement)
AGENTS.md:Symlink to CLAUDE.md (both agent runtimes read the same file)
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md:System architecture and boundaries
docs/QUALITY.md:All enforced invariants with rationale
docs/COMMANDS.md:Every pnpm script, organized by purpose
docs/RUNBOOKS.md:Operational procedures
docs/DEPLOYMENT.md:Build, migrate, deploy, smoke test
apps/api/openapi.json:Generated OpenAPI spec (source of truth for API contract)


## Stack

apps/api:Effect HttpApi server. Auth, organizations, invitations. Generates its own OpenAPI spec.
apps/web:Client-only Next.js SPA. Two route groups: (website) for public marketing (landing, blog, pricing, terms, privacy) and (application) for authenticated org/team dashboard. No server code, no Effect, no Drizzle. Config-driven content, backend-agnostic blog, JSON-LD structured data, breadcrumbs.
apps/worker:Temporal worker. Deterministic workflows, activities handle side effects.
apps/mobile:Expo React Native. Same API, same contracts as web.
apps/docs:Fumadocs documentation site (port 3002).
packages/core:DDD domain slices under packages/core/src/domains/<domain>/. Business logic lives here.
packages/infra/db:Drizzle schema, repositories, migrations, pgTAP tests. Only package that imports drizzle-orm.
packages/contracts:Shared API schemas using effect/Schema. Single source of truth for validation.
packages/infra/auth:Password hashing and JWT. Thin on purpose.
packages/infra/logging:Structured JSON logger. console.* is lint-banned everywhere.
packages/infra/observability:OpenTelemetry bootstrap. Traces, metrics, logs via OTLP.
packages/testkit:Integration harnesses, lock-guarded runners, DB reset helpers.
packages/tooling:ESLint configs, domain invariant rules, scaffold CLI.


## Prerequisites

Node.js 22+, pnpm 10+, Docker Desktop 24+, Temporal CLI. 1Password CLI optional (deploy only).


## Quickstart

pnpm install
pnpm env:configure
pnpm infra:ensure
pnpm temporal:dev:up
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev


## Local endpoints

Web: http://localhost:3000
API: http://localhost:4000
Docs: http://localhost:3002
Temporal UI: http://localhost:8233
Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
Jaeger: http://localhost:16686
Grafana: http://localhost:3001


## Key constraints

Validation: effect/Schema only. Zod is banned.
Logging: console.* is banned. Use @tx-agent-kit/logging.
Persistence: only packages/infra/db imports drizzle-orm.
Web boundary: apps/web never imports DB, Effect, or server modules. Every .tsx starts with 'use client'.
Domain determinism: no Date.now, new Date, or Math.random in domain code. Inject via ports.
Temporal determinism: no native timers, no infra imports inside workflows.
Kind markers: routes and repositories declare crud or custom. Enforced by structural checks.
Type safety: as any, chained assertions, and suppression directives are banned in source.
Test colocation: use file.test.ts and file.integration.test.ts. No __tests__/ dirs or .spec.ts files.
Env governance: source modules read env through dedicated env modules, never process.env directly.


## DDD pattern

packages/core/src/domains/<domain>/
  domain/      :Entities, value objects, pure rules
  ports/       :Interfaces and capability contracts
  application/ :Use-case orchestration
  adapters/    :Port implementations
  runtime/     :Layer wiring (optional)

Dependencies point inward: domain <- ports <- application <- adapters <- runtime.


## Golden path (new feature)

pnpm scaffold:crud --domain <name> --entity <name> --dry-run
pnpm scaffold:crud --domain <name> --entity <name>
Add contracts in packages/contracts with effect/Schema.
Add domain logic in packages/core/src/domains/<name>/.
Update packages/infra/db/src/schema.ts + matching effect-schemas/ and factories/.
Expose routes in apps/api, run pnpm openapi:generate.
Regenerate clients: pnpm api:client:generate.
Validate: pnpm lint && pnpm type-check && pnpm test.


## Enforcement layers

ESLint: packages/tooling/eslint-config/domain-invariants.js:Import bans, pattern bans, boundary rules.
Structural: scripts/lint/enforce-domain-invariants.mjs:Table parity, kind consistency, folder structure.
Shell: scripts/check-shell-invariants.sh:Env governance, integration baselines.
Gate: pnpm lint runs all three layers. Failure blocks merge.


## Quality gates

pnpm lint              # ESLint + structural + shell invariants
pnpm type-check        # TypeScript compilation
pnpm test              # Unit tests (Vitest)
pnpm test:integration  # Integration tests (lock-guarded, idempotent DB reset)
pnpm test:db:pgtap     # Database trigger contract tests

Quiet variants (pnpm lint:quiet, test:quiet, etc.) reduce output for agent workflows.


## Infrastructure

Docker Compose runs: PostgreSQL (5432), Redis (6379), OTEL Collector (4318), Prometheus (9090), Jaeger (16686), Grafana (3001), Loki (3100).
Temporal CLI runs as a standalone process on port 7233.
pnpm infra:ensure is idempotent. pnpm temporal:dev:up is idempotent.
Worktrees get collision-free ports via pnpm worktree:ports <name>.


## Deployment

pnpm deploy:build-images:Immutable containers, digest-pinned.
pnpm deploy:migrate:staging:Drizzle migrations via 1Password.
pnpm deploy:staging:op inject, docker compose up, smoke test.
pnpm deploy:smoke:Health, auth, CRUD, idempotency verification.


## API reference

Three endpoint groups: Auth (/v1/auth/*), Organizations (/v1/organizations/*), Invitations (/v1/invitations/*).
Team CRUD: /v1/teams/* for team management within organizations.
Bearer JWT auth on all routes except sign-up, sign-in, and /health.
Cursor-based pagination on list endpoints.
Full spec: apps/api/openapi.json.


## Web architecture

Route groups:
(website):Public marketing site (landing, blog, pricing, terms, privacy). Layout wraps WebsiteHeader + WebsiteFooter.
(application):Authenticated app shell. Auth-guard layout checks token, redirects to /sign-in if missing.
Auth pages:sign-in, sign-up, forgot-password, reset-password at app root with split-panel layout.

Org/team routing:
/org:Smart redirect (resolves first org + first team → /org/{orgId}/{teamId}).
/org/{orgId}/workspaces:Team listing and creation within an org.
/org/{orgId}/{teamId}:Team dashboard.

Config-driven content:
apps/web/config/index.ts:Company info, homepage (hero, features, FAQs, CTA), blog, dashboard nav. No Stripe price IDs.

SEO infrastructure:
apps/web/lib/seo.ts:buildTitle, buildDescription, Organization/WebPage/BreadcrumbList/FAQPage structured data.
apps/web/lib/blog.ts:Backend-agnostic BlogDataSource interface. Pluggable blog backend.
apps/web/lib/blog-seo.ts:BlogPosting and Blog JSON-LD builders.
apps/web/components/Breadcrumbs.tsx:Breadcrumb navigation component.
apps/web/components/StructuredData.tsx:JSON-LD script renderer.
apps/web/app/sitemap.ts:All marketing page URLs.
apps/web/app/robots.ts:Disallows authenticated routes.

Permissions:
Migration 0008 seeds admin/member roles with 17 permission actions.
packages/contracts/src/literals.ts:permissionActions array + PermissionAction type.
Admin gets all; member gets safe subset (excludes manage_organization, manage_billing, etc.).
