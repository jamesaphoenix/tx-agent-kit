title: Welcome to tx-agent-kit
description: Agent-first starter for Effect HTTP + Temporal + Next.js + Drizzle
---

tx-agent-kit is an **agent-first starter kit** for building production-grade TypeScript applications. It combines Effect HTTP, Temporal workflows, Next.js, Drizzle ORM, and Expo React Native into a single monorepo with mechanical enforcement of architectural decisions.

## What is "agent-first"?

Inspired by [OpenAI's Harness Engineering post](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/) and [Anthropic's guide to effective harnesses for long-running agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents), tx-agent-kit encodes a specific operating model:

**Humans** steer intent, define acceptance criteria, and make architectural decisions. **Agents** implement features, validate correctness, and iterate through mechanical checks. **The repository** is the single source of truth. `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` encode taste and constraints so agents can operate autonomously within defined guardrails.

If an agent fails repeatedly, the response is not to micromanage. It is to improve scaffolding: better docs, stricter linters, more tests, smarter scripts.

## What is included

The kit ships with a complete vertical slice across four application targets:

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **API** | Effect HttpApi | Auth, organizations, invitations |
| **Web** | Next.js (client-only SPA) | Marketing site (blog, pricing, terms, privacy) + authenticated org/team dashboard |
| **Worker** | Temporal | Background workflows and activities |
| **Mobile** | Expo React Native | Cross-platform mobile client |

Supporting packages provide domain logic (`core`), database access (`db`), shared contracts (`contracts`), authentication (`auth`), structured logging (`logging`), OpenTelemetry observability (`observability`), and test utilities (`testkit`).

## Where to start

Start with **[Philosophy](/docs/philosophy)** to understand the agent-first thesis, then move to **[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started)** to set up your environment and scaffold your first domain. **[Architecture](/docs/architecture)** covers the monorepo structure, DDD pattern, and data flow, while **[Core Concepts](/docs/core-concepts)** walks through Effect services, domain modeling, ports and adapters, and schema contracts. From there, **[Enforcement](/docs/enforcement)** shows how every architectural decision is mechanically checked, **[Infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure)** covers Docker services and local development, **[Deployment](/docs/deployment)** handles staging and production workflows, and **[Commands](/docs/commands)** is the full reference of pnpm scripts.

## Design principles

1. **Encode taste in tooling.** If a convention matters, it is enforced by a linter rule, a structural invariant check, or a shell script, not a wiki page.
2. **Inward-only dependencies.** Domain logic never depends on infrastructure. The dependency arrow always points inward.
3. **Schema-first contracts.** `effect/Schema` is the single validation library. Contracts are shared, typed, and enforced at compile time.
4. **Deterministic domains.** No `Date.now`, `Math.random`, or side effects in domain code. Everything is injectable and testable.
5. **Separation of concerns.** The web app never touches the database. The API never renders HTML. The worker never serves HTTP.
